# Options Mod

Cause many mods need options ?

# How? Hwat?

This mod is a cut down version of fabric-carpet (https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet).
Changes are: All or most code that wasn't required for the extensions, rule and command system was removed.
    README, comments, variable names, filenames etc. were changed to optionsmod instead of carpet or fabric-carpet.
This mod only exists to supply other mods with carpet's simple way of adding new commands for gamerules ("carpetrules")

Follow instructions for all other fabric mods in https://fabricmc.net/use/ and dump optionsmod...jar in `mods` folder along
with other compatible mods.
